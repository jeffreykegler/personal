    4th century BCE: Panini's description of Sanskrit
    </h1>
    <p>In India, Panini creates an exact description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit can be
      completely reconstructed using nothing but Panini's grammar.
      Panini's grammar, which predates Euclid,
      is probably the first formal system of any kind.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
    </p>
    <p>By the 1940's and 1950's,
      Panini will be well known and much studied in the Western linguistics
      community,
      but will be almost unknown to non-linguists outside of India.
      Panini's effect on the other events in this timeline will be indirect.

    1854: Ada discovers computer "language"
    </h1>
    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly see that <b>programming</b> a computer
    is a distinct discipline from
    <b>building</b> the computer itself.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    By 2023, this
    hardware/software distinction
    will be so well known as to seem obvious.</p>
    <p>Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>

    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.

      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>

      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.

    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language

      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.

      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.

      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    <h1 id="h1-the_operator_issue_as_of_1949">
    The Operator Issue as of 1949
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.

    1950: Boehm's compiler
    </h1>
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.

      Specifically, in 1952,

      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term

      will acquire a different meaning,

      (By this Knuth will mean that

    1954: The FORTRAN project begins

    <h1 id="text-1954-term-compiler">"Compiler" as of 1954</h1>
    <p>In June 1954, an ACM committee including John Backus and Grace Hopper issues
    a "First Glossary of Programming Terminology",
    which defines the term "compiler" as
    <blockquote>
    a executive routine which,
    <b>before</b> the desired computation is started,
    translates a program expressed in pseudo-code into
    machine code (or into another pseudo-code for
    further translation by an interpreter)."<a id="footnote-27-ref" href="#footnote-27">[27]</a>
    </blockquote>
    The "pseudo-code" of the Committee is what in 2023
    will be called a "programming language".<a id="footnote-28-ref" href="#footnote-28">[28]</a>
    The definition goes on to detail the various tasks
    a "compiler" might perform.
    These include what in 2023 will be called
    "linking" and "loading", so that the ACM committee's
    redefinition of compiler
    can be seen as a broadening of Hopper's use of the term.<a id="footnote-29-ref" href="#footnote-29">[29]</a>
      It is not clear if the ACM committee's new definition
      captures a current usage of the term "compiler",
      or if it is a prescriptive redefinition, intended to change usage.
    </p>
    <p>As the computer field develops, the textbook definition
    will expand beyond the ACM Committee's implementation-focused one,
    so that a "compiler" is any translator from one language (the "source language")
    to another (the "target language").
    And linkers and loaders will often not be consider a part of the
    compiler in the more proper sense.
    But in its essentials,
    the most common usage of the term "compiler" in 2023
    will be as it is defined by the ACM committee.
    </p>
    <p>Note that, even though they were not called "compilers",
    compilers in the ACM committee sense of the term had been
      envisioned even before Hopper first used the term.
      But nobody had called these programs compilers -- they
      were called
      <q>automatic coding</q>,

    <p>In his "Three models" paper,
      Chomsky says that
    </p><blockquote>
      By a language then, we shall mean a set (finite or infinite) of
      sentences, each of finite length, all constructed from a finite
      alphabet of symbols.<a id="footnote-39-ref" href="#footnote-39">[39]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is exactly Bloomfield's definition,
      restated using set theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nonetheless signs of departure from the behaviorist orthodoxy are
      apparent in "Three Models" --
      Chomsky is quite willing to talk about what sentences mean,
      when it serves his purposes.
      For a utterance with multiple meanings,
      Chomsky's new model produces multiple syntactic derivations.
      Each of these syntactic derivations
      "looks" like the natural representation
      of one of the meanings.
      Chomsky points out that the insight into semantics
      that his new model provides is a very
      desirable property to have.<a id="footnote-40-ref" href="#footnote-40">[40]</a>

    <p>Chomsky is a turning point, so much so that he establishes or settles the
      meaning of many of the terms we are using.
      A
      <term>parser</term>,
      for our purposes, is something or someone that transforms
      a string of symbols into a
      structure,
      according to a description
      of the mapping from strings to structures.
      For our purposes,
      the structures can usually be considered to be parse trees.</p>
    <h1 id="h1-term_recognizer">
    Term: "Recognizer"
    </h1>
    <p>In contrast to a parser,
      a
      <term>recognizer</term>
      is a something or someone that
      takes a string and answers
      <q>yes</q>
      or
      <q>no</q>
      --
      <q>yes</q>
      if the string is in the language described by the recognizer,
      <q>no</q>
      otherwise.
      Note that,
      if we intend to do semantics,
      a recognizer alone is not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>In the strict sense, a recognizer cannot drive a compiler --
      a compiler needs a parser.
      But recognizers can be far easier to write,
      and are often hacked up
      and pressed into service as parsers.
      For example, if your semantics is simple and non-recursive,
      you might be able to drive your semantics phase with
      the output of
      a regex engine, using captures.

    <p>The designers of FORTRAN use a strange trick for parsing operator expressions --

      The number of parentheses varied, depending on the operator.
      Surprisingly, this works.
      In fact, once the theoretical

      Oettinger's paper is full of evidence that stacks
      are still very new.
      For a start, he does not call them stacks --
      he calls them "pushdown stores".
      And Oettinger does not assume his highly sophisticated audience
      knows what the "push"
      and "pop" operations are --
      he defines them based on
      another set of operations --
      one that eventually will form the basis
      of the APL language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oettinger's definitions all follow the behavorist model --
      they are sets of strings.<a id="footnote-50-ref" href="#footnote-50">[50]</a>
      Oettinger's mathematical model of stacks
      will come to be called

      Oettinger's own field is Russian translation.
      He hopes that DPDA's

      the study of both computer and
      natural language translation.
      DPDA's soon prove totally inadequate

      DPDA's will have a much longer life.

    <p>A top-down parser deduces the constituents of a rule from the rule.
      That is, it looks at the rule first,
      and then deduces what is on its RHS.
      Thus, it works from the start rule, and works
      <q>top down</q>
      until it arrives at the input tokens.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to note that no useful parser can be purely top-down --
      if a parser worked purely top-down, it would never look at its input.
      So every top-parser we will consider has
      <em>some</em>
      kind of bottom-up element.
      That bottom-up element may be very simple -- for example, one character lookahead.
      The
      <a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>
      parser,
      like most later top-down parsers,
      has a sophisticated bottom-up element.

    <h1 id="h1-term_bottom_up">
    Term: "Bottom-up"

    <p>A bottom-up parser deduces a rule from its constituents.
      That is, it looks at either the input or at the LHS symbols

      and from that deduces a rule.
      Thus, it works from the input tokens, and works
      <q>bottom up</q>
      until it reaches the start rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as no really useful parser is purely top-down,
      no really useful parser is purely bottom-up.
      It it true that
      the
      <b>implementation</b>
      of a useful parser might be 100% bottom-up.
      But a useful
      parser must do more than return all possible partitions of the input --
      it must
      implement some criteria for preferring some parse trees over
      others.
      Implicitly, these criteria come "from the top".
    </p><p>
    </p><p>
      In fact,
      bottom-up parsers will often be pressed into service
      for Chomskyan parsing,
      and the Chomskyan approach is inherently top down.
      Even when it comes to implementation,
      bottom-up parsers will often use
      explicit top-down logic.
      For efficiency it is usually necessary to eliminate unwanted
      parses trees while parsing,

    Sakai's algorithm is impractically slow for large inputs<a id="footnote-65-ref" href="#footnote-65">[65]</a>.
    But Sakai's algorithm will remain useful in very special circumstances.
    These are applications where no method is capable of parsing long inputs in reasonable
    time,
    and where the grammar is conveniently described in terms of the frequency of adjacent
    components.
    This will make Sakai's a good fit with some statistically-based approaches

    <p>A parsing algorithm is "table-driven" if it tracks the

    <h1 id="h1-the_operator_issue_as_of_1961">
    The Operator Issue as of 1961
    </h1>
    <p>The results of 1961 transform the Operator Issue.
      Up until ALGOL,
      parsing has essentially
      been parsing operator expressions.
      After ALGOL, almost all languages will be block-structured
      and ad hoc string manipulations will no longer be adequate --
      the language as a whole will require a serious parsing technique.
      Parsing operator expressions will be a side show.
      Or so it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not use the
      algorithms that parse operator expressions for the whole
      language?
      <a href="#bib-Samelson_and_Bauer_1959">Samelson and Bauer 1959</a>
      had suggested
      exactly that.
      But, alas, operator expression parsing is not adequate for
      languages as a whole<a id="footnote-71-ref" href="#footnote-71">[71]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Also, as of 1961, we have BNF.
      This gives us a useful notation
      for describing grammars.
      BNF allows us to introduce our Basic Operator Grammar (BASIC-OP):
    </p>
    <pre id="g-basic-op"><tt>
      S ::= E
      E ::= E + T
      E ::= T
      T ::= T * F
      T ::= F
      F ::= number
    </tt></pre>
    <p><a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>
      has two operators, three levels of precedence
      and left associativity.
      This is enough to challenge the primitive parsing techniques in use
      before 1961.
      Surprisingly, this simple grammar will continue to bedevil mainstream parsing theory for the
      next half a century.
    </p><p>
      Recursive descent, it turns out,
      cannot parse
      <a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>
      because BASIC-OP is left recursive.
      And that is not the end of it.
      Making addition and multiplication right-associate
      is unnatural and,
      as the authors of the IT compiler had found out,
      causes users to revolt.
      But suppose we try to use this
      Right-recursive Operator Grammar (RIGHT-OP)
      anyway:
    </p>
    <pre id="g-right-op"><tt>
      S ::= E
      E ::= T + E
      E ::= T
      T ::= F * T
      T ::= F
      F ::= number
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
      Recursive descent, without help,
      cannot parse
      <a href="#g-right-op">RIGHT-OP</a>.
      As of 1961,
      parsing theory has not developed well enough to
      state why in precise terms.
      Suffice it to say for now
      that
      <a href="#g-rr">RIGHT-OP</a>
      requires too much lookahead.
    </p>
    <p>Recursive descent does have a huge advantage,
      one which, despite its severe limitations,
      will save it from obsolescence time and again.
      Hand-written recursive descent is essentially calling
      subroutines.
      Adding custom modification to recursive descent
      is very straight-forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition,
      while pure recursive descent cannot
      <em>parse</em>
      operator expressions,
      it can
      <em>recognize</em>
      them.
      Pure recursive descent may not be able to create
      the parse subtree for an operator expression itself.
      But it can recognize the expression,
      and hand control
      over to a specialized operator expression parser.
      This seems to be what Lucas' 1961 algorithm did,
      and it is certainly what many other implementations did afterwards.
      Adding the operator expression subparser makes the implementation
      only quasi-Chomskyan,
      but this is a price the profession
      will be willing to pay.
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively,
      a recursive descent implementation can parse operator expressions
      as lists,
      and add associativity in post-processing.
      This pushes some of the more important parsing
      out of the syntactic phase into the semantics
      but, once again,
      it seems that
      Chomskyan purity will have to be thrown overboard
      if the ship is to stay afloat.
    </p>
    <p>Bottom line: as of 1961 the Operator Issue takes a new form.
      Because of the Operator Issue,
      recursive descent is not
      sufficient for practical grammars -- it must always be part of a
      hybrid.
    </p>
    <p>In this context,
      Dijkstra's new 1961 algorithm is a welcome alternative:
      as an operator expression subparser,
      it can parse operator expressions faster and in less space.
      But Dijkstra's algorithm has no more parsing power
      than the classic operator
      precedence algorithm --
      it does nothing to change the basic tradeoffs.

      As of 1965 this notion becomes more precise,
      thanks to a notation that Knuth borrows from
      calculus.
      This
      <q>big O</q>
      notation characterizes algorithms
      using functions, but it treats functions that
      differ by a constant multiple as identical<a id="footnote-73-ref" href="#footnote-73">[73]</a>.
      <q>Ignoring the constant</q>
      means that conclusions

      results stay relevant in the face of steady improvements

    <p>
      These big O functions take as their input some aspect of the algorithm's

      In the case of parsing, by convention,
      the big O function is usually a function
      of the length of the input<a id="footnote-74-ref" href="#footnote-74">[74]</a>.
      Of the many possible

        can be
        written O(n*log n).

      <li>A function which grows as the square of the length

        <q>quadratic</q>
        -- O(n**2).
      </li>
      <li>A function which grows as the cube of the length
        is called
        <q>cubic</q>
        -- O(n**3).
      </li>
      <li>In extreme cases,
        a function can grow as a constant taken to the power
        of the length, or
        <term>exponentially</term>
        --
        O(c**n).
      </li>

    <p>
      By this time,
      <q>efficient</q>
      for a parser means

      or

      Parsers which operate in quadratic, cubic, or exponential
      time are

      any parser which uses backtracking is potentially exponential

    <h1 id="text-1965-knuth">1965: Knuth discovers LR</h1>
    <p>Donald Knuth answers<a id="footnote-75-ref" href="#footnote-75">[75]</a>
      the challenge expressed
      a few years earlier by
      <a href="#text-1960-Oettinger">Oettinger</a>.
      Oettinger had hoped for a theory of stack-based
      parsing
      to replace "ad hoc invention".<a id="footnote-76-ref" href="#footnote-76">[76]</a>
      Knuth responds with a theory that
      encompasses all the "tricks"<a id="footnote-77-ref" href="#footnote-77">[77]</a>
      used for efficient parsing up to that time.
      In an exhilarating and exhausting 39-page
      paper,
      Knuth shows that stack-based parsing is
      equivalent to a new class of grammars.
      Knuth calls this new class, LR(k).
      Knuth also provides a parsing algorithm for the
      LR(k) grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knuth's new LR parsing algorithm is deterministic,
      Chomskyan and bottom-up.
      It might be expected to be "the one to rule
      them all".
      Unfortunately, while linear,
      it is not practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      LR(k) is actually a set of grammar classes.
      There is a grammar class for every
      <tt>k</tt>,
      where
      <tt>k</tt>
      is the amount of lookahead used.
      LR(0) requires no lookahead,
      but it is not practical because it is too weak
      to parse most grammars of interest.
      LR(1) is not practical
      because of the size of the tables it requires --
      well beyond what can be done with 1965
      hardware.<a id="footnote-78-ref" href="#footnote-78">[78]</a>
      </p>
      <p>As the <tt>k</tt> in LR(k) grows,
      LR(k) becomes more impractical rapidly.
      The size of the tables grows exponentially,
      while the value of the additional lookahead rapidly diminishes.
      It is not likely that
      LR(2)
      parsing will ever see much actual use,
      never mind
      LR(k) for any <tt>k</tt>
      greater than 2.

    "Language" as of 1965
    </h1>
    <p><a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>
      uses the Bloomfieldian definition of
      language,
      following the rest
      of the parsing literature at this time.
      In other words, Knuth defines a language
      a "set of strings", without regard
      to their meaning.
      The Bloomfieldian definition,
      while severely restrictive,
      has yet to cause any recognizable harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep things straight,
      I will borrow two terms from linguistics:
      "intension" and "extension".
      For this discussion,
      I will speak of the "set of strings" that make
      up a language as its
      <b>extension</b>.
      If you are a Bloomfieldian,
      a language
      <b>is</b>
      its extension.
    </p>
    <p>The vast majority of people have always thought that,
      to be considered a language,
      a set of strings has to have a semantics --
      that is, the strings must mean something.
      I will call the semantics of a language
      its
      <b>intension</b>.<a id="footnote-79-ref" href="#footnote-79">[79]</a>
      A language is extensional
      (or Bloomfieldian) if it consists only of an
      extension.
      A language is intensional
      if it consists of both an intension and
      an extension.
      (All languages have extensions.<a id="footnote-80-ref" href="#footnote-80">[80]</a>)
      For most people, the term "language" means
      an intensional language.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 1965, you can argue that using the Bloomfieldian definition
      has been helpful.
      It
      <b>is</b>
      easier to do math with an extensional language.
      And the results in terms of its extension often do apply
      to an intensional language.
      For example, Chomsky, to demonstrate the
      superiority of his model over Markov chains,
      showed that the extension of his model of English
      contains strings which clearly are English,
      but which are not predicted by Markov chains.
      Obviously, your model of an intensional language is wrong
      if its extension is wrong,
      and if you can discover that without delving into
      semantics, all the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knuth wants to show a relationship
      between his LR grammars,
      and the mathematical literature on
      stack-based parsing (DPDA's).
      The trouble is, the DPDA literature is
      entirely non-Chomskyan --
      all of its results are in terms of sets
      of strings.
      Knuth is forced to
      "compare apples to oranges"
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you show that string-sets
      are the equivalent of grammars?
      What Knuth does is treat them both as string-sets -- extensions.
      Knuth compares the language extensions of the LR grammars
      to the sets of strings recognized by the DPDA's.
    </p>
    <p>The result certainly seems encouraging.
      It turns out that the language extension of
      deterministic stack machines
      is
      <b>exactly</b>
      that of the
      LR
      grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you take language extensions as a proxy for grammars,
      things fall into place very neatly:
      the
      LR-parsers are the deterministic subset of the
      context-free parsers.
      And "deterministic" seems like a very good approximation
      of practical.
      All practical parsers in 1965 are
      deterministic parsers.<a id="footnote-81-ref" href="#footnote-81">[81]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed this way,
      LR-parsing looks like the theoretical equivalent
      of practical parsing --
      at least it is
      as close to an exact equivalent of practical parsing
      as theory is likely to get.
      Based on the algorithms of
      <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>,
      that means that the theoretical equivalent of "practical
      parsing" is somewhere between LR(0) and LR(1).
    </p>
    <p id="text-LR-hierarchy-collapse">Not all the signs are promising, however.
      In fact, one of them is ominous.
      LR
      grammars form a hierarchy --
      for every
      k&#8805;0,
      there is an
      LR
      grammar which
      is
      LR(k+1), but which is not
      LR(k).
      But if you just look at sets of strings,
      this hierarchy pancakes.
      Every
      LR(k)
      language extension is also
      an
      LR(1)
      language extension,
      as long as
      k&#8805;1.
    </p>
    <p>It gets worse.
      In most practical applications,
      you can add an end-of-input marker to a grammar.<a id="footnote-82-ref" href="#footnote-82">[82]</a>,
      If you do this,
      every
      LR(k)
      language extension is also an
      LR(0)
      language extension.
      In terms of strings-sets,
      there is no LR hierarchy:
    </p><center>
      LR(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;LR(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;LR(2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;LR(42)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;...
    </center>
    <p>In short,
      as a proxy for LR grammars,
      LR language extensions look like they might be completely worthless.<a id="footnote-83-ref" href="#footnote-83">[83]</a>

      it convinces most that stack-based,
      and therefore LR, parsing
      is the framework for the solution.<a id="footnote-84-ref" href="#footnote-84">[84]</a>
      To be sure,
      there is no proof,

    <ul>
      <li>In 1965, every practical parser is stack-driven.<a id="footnote-85-ref" href="#footnote-85">[85]</a></li>
      <li>An algorithm that combines state transitions and stack operations is
        already a challenge to existing machines.
        In 1965, any more complicated algorithm is likely to be unuseable
        in practice.<a id="footnote-86-ref" href="#footnote-86">[86]</a>
      </li>
      <li>For LR(k) grammars, practical parsing is bracketed somewhere

      <li>In terms of what the parsing literature calls "languages"

        LR(k) parsing is the exact equivalent of deterministic stack-based parsing.</li>
      <li>Determinism is always linear and, at least in terms of speed,
      linear is almost always practical.</li>
      <li>In 1965, every practical parser is deterministic.</li>
      <li>In general, power is a trade-off for speed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are also aesthetic reasons to
      think that this theoretical equivalent for practical
      parsing is not all that rough.
      Recall that deterministic stack-based parsing is
      "exactly" LR-parsing.
      It is also the case
      that non-deterministic stack-based parsing is
      "exactly" context-free parsing.
      This symmetry is very elegant,
      and suggests that the theoreticians have uncovered
      the basic laws behind parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, "exactly" here means "exactly in terms of extensions".
      Extensions are used in this reasoning,
      while the actual interest is in intensions.
      <a href="#text-LR-hierarchy-collapse">And for extensions
        the LR hierarchy collapses</a>.
      But in 1965 these things are
      not considered troubling.
    </p>

      After all, there is no exact theoretical equivalent
      of "practical" --
      you always have to settle for a more or less rough equivalent.
      Reasoning in terms of extensions had not bitten anyone yet.
      And, while nobody had been more authoritative about the limits of
      extensions as a definition of language than Chomsky
      (he had literally written the book),
      Chomsky himself had
      used extensions
      to produce some of his most
      impressive results.

      After 1965, the consensus
      excludes the idea that algorithms which target supersets of LR(k) might be faster than those that take on LR(k)
      directly.<a id="footnote-87-ref" href="#footnote-87">[87]</a>.
      But, what if the LR language hierarchy collapse is a real
      problem?
      If we remove the evidence based on language extensions from the list above,
      all we have left are couple of over-generalizations.
      So the question remains:
    </p><blockquote>
      Is there a non-deterministic parser that is linear for
      the LR(k) grammars, or even a superset of them?

    The Operator Issue as of 1965
    </h1>
    <p><a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>
      is a significant milestone
      in the history of operator expression parsing.
      Knuth specifically addresses the parsing of ALGOL
      and he zeroes in on its arithmetic expressions
      as the crucial issue<a id="footnote-88-ref" href="#footnote-88">[88]</a>.
      Knuth suggests a "typical" grammar<a id="footnote-89-ref" href="#footnote-89">[89]</a>
      which is short,
      but encapsulates the parsing challenges
      presented by ALGOL's arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre id="g-knuth-op"><tt>
      S ::= E
      E ::= - T
      E ::= T
      E ::= E - T
      T ::= P
      T ::= T * P
      P ::= a
      P ::= ( E )
    </tt></pre>
    <p><a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>
      is left-recursive,
      allows parentheses,
      has three levels of precedence,
      and implements both unary and
      binary minus.
      Recursive descent cannot parse
      <a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>,
      but <a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>
      is LR(1).
      The means that it is well within Knuth's new
      class of grammars and,
      by implication,
      probably within a practical subclass of the
      LR grammars.

    <h1 id="h1-1968_lewis_and_stearns_discover_ll">
    1968: Lewis and Stearns discover LL
    </h1>
    <p>When Knuth discovered the LR grammars, he announced them to
      the world with a full-blown mathematical description.
      The top-down
      grammars, which arose historically,
      have lacked such a description.
      In 1968,
      Lewis and Stearns fill that gap by defining the LL(k) grammars<a id="footnote-90-ref" href="#footnote-90">[90]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="h1-terms_ll_and_lr">
    Terms: "LL" and "LR"
    </h1>
    <p>When LL is added to the vocabulary of parsing, the meaning of
      <term>LR</term>
      shifts slightly. In 1965 Knuth defined LR to mean
      <q>translatable from left to right</q><a id="footnote-91-ref" href="#footnote-91">[91]</a>.
      But LL means
      <q>scan from the left, using left reductions</q>
      and, in response, the meaning of LR shifts to become
      <q>scan from the left, using
        right reductions</q><a id="footnote-92-ref" href="#footnote-92">[92]</a>.
    </p><p>If there is a number in parentheses in this notation for
      parsing algorithms, it usually indicates the number of tokens of
      lookahead.
      For example, LL(1) means
      <q>scan from the
        left, using left reductions with one character of lookahead</q>.
      LL(1) will be important.

      and
      <a href="#bib-Lewis_and_Stearns_1968">Lewis and Stearns 1968</a>,
      we can now restate the problem with recursive descent
      and operator expressions in precise terms:
      Recursive descent
      in its pure form,
      is LL(1).
      Arithmetic operator grammars are not LL(1) -- not even close.
      In fact,
      of the grammars
      <a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>,
      <a href="#g-right-op">RIGHT-OP</a>,
      and
      <a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>,
      none is LL(k) for any k.
    </p>
    <p>A common work-around is to have recursive descent parse
      arithmetic expressions as lists,
      and add associativity in post-processing.
      We are now able to look at this in more detail.
      An extended BNF grammar to recognize
      <a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>
      as a list is as follows:
    </p><pre id="g-elist-op"><tt>
      S  ::= E

      TI ::= '+' T
      T  ::= F { FI } *
      FI ::= 'x' F
      F  ::= number
    </tt></pre><p>
      In the above
      <tt>{Z}*</tt>
      means
      <q>zero or more occurrences of Z</q>.
      Expanded into pure BNF,
      and avoiding empty right hand sides,
      our operator "list" grammar becomes
      LIST-OP:
    </p><pre id="g-list-op"><tt>
      S  ::= E
      E  ::= T TL
      E  ::= T
      TL ::= TI

      TI ::= '+' T
      T  ::= F FL
      T  ::= F
      FL ::= FI
      FL ::= FI FL
      FI ::= 'x' F
      F  ::= number
    </tt></pre>
    <p><a href="g-list=op">LIST-OP</a>
      is LL(1),
      and therefore can be parsed directly
      by recursive descent.
      Note that in
      <a href="g-list-op">LIST-OP</a>,
      although associativity must be provided by a post-processor,
      the grammar enforces precedence.

      LR-regular (LRR) grammars are LR with lookahead that is

      The restriction is that to tell the strings apart,
      you must use a finite set of regular expressions.

      grammars that humans can spot by "eyeball".

      that practical parsing falls short of LR(1), never mind LRR,

    <h1 id="h1-1973_pratt_parsing">
    1973: Pratt parsing
    </h1>
    <p>As we have noted, pure LL(1) cannot parse operator expressions,
      and so operator expression parsers are often called into service
      as subparsers.
      What about
      making the entire grammar an operator grammar?
      This idea had already occurred to Samelson and Bauer in 1959.
      In 1973, Vaughan Pratt revives it<a id="footnote-104-ref" href="#footnote-104">[104]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>There are problems with switching to operator
      grammars.
      Operator grammars are non-Chomskyan -- the BNF no longer
      accurately describes the grammar.
      Instead the BNF becomes part of
      a combined notation, and the actual grammar parsed depends also on
      precedence, associativity,
      and semantics.
      And operator grammars have a very restricted
      form -- most practical languages are not operator grammars.</p>
    <p>But many practical grammars are almost operator grammars. And the
      Chomskyan approach has always had its dissenters.
      Vaughn Pratt is one
      of these, and discovers a new approach
      to operator expression parsing:
      Pratt parsing is the third and last approach in
      Theodore
      Norvell's taxonomy of approaches to operator expression
      parsing<a id="footnote-105-ref" href="#footnote-105">[105]</a>.
      Some will adopt Pratt parsing
      as the overall solution to their parsing problems<a id="footnote-106-ref" href="#footnote-106">[106]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>As of 2023, the Pratt approach
      will not be popular as an overall strategy.
      Under the name precedence climbing,
      it will most often be used
      as a subparser within a recursive descent strategy.
      All
      operator expression subparsers break the Chomskyan paradigm so the
      non-Chomskyan nature of Pratt's parser is not a problem in this
      context.

      parsers, debugging them is so hard they could just as easily write the
      parser by hand.
      Once debugged, their LALR parsers are fast for correct
      inputs.
      But almost all they tell the users about incorrect inputs
      is that they are incorrect.
      In Larry Wall's words, LALR is
      <q>fast
        but stupid</q><a id="footnote-116-ref" href="#footnote-116">[116]</a>.

      On the written record, the discontent with LALR and

      is hard to find.
      What programmer wants to announce to colleagues and
      potential employers that he cannot figure
      how to make the standard state-of-the-art tool work?
      But a movement away from LALR has already begun.
      Parsing practice falls back on
      recursive descent.

    1992: Combinator parsing
    </h1>
    <p>
      Combinator parsing
      is introduced in two papers published this year.<a id="footnote-117-ref" href="#footnote-117">[117]</a>
      Of more interest
      to us is <a href="#bib-Hutton_1992">Hutton 1992</a>,
	which focuses on combinator parsing<a id="footnote-118-ref" href="#footnote-118">[118]</a>.
      As Hutton explains<a id="footnote-119-ref" href="#footnote-119">[119]</a>
      a combinator is an attribute grammar
      with one inherited attribute (the input string)
      and two synthesized attributes (the value of the node
      and the remaining part of the input string).
      Combinators can be
      <q>combined</q>
      to compose other parsers.
      This allows you to have an algebra of parsers.
      It is an extremely attractive idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exciting as the new mathematics is,
      the underlying parsing theory contains
      nothing new --
      it is the decades-old recursive descent,
      unchanged.
      Hutton's example language is extremely basic --
      his operator expressions require left association,
      but not precedence.
      Left association is implemented by post-processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hutton's main presentation does not use monads.
      In his final pages, however,
      Hutton points out
      <q>combinator parsers give rise to a monad</q>
      and shows
      how his presentation could be rewritten in a form
      closely related to monads<a id="footnote-120-ref" href="#footnote-120">[120]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="h1-1995_wadler_s_monads">
    1995: Wadler's monads
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the adaptation of monads into the world of
      programming,
      <a href="#bib-Wadler_1995">Wadler 1995</a>
      is a turning point.
      One of Wadler's examples is a parser based on
      monads and combinator parsing.
      Combinator parsing becomes the standard
      example of monad programming.
    </p>
    <p>In its monadic form,
      the already attractive technique of combinator parsing is extremely elegant
      and certainly seems as if it
      <em>should</em>
      solve all parsing problems.
      But, once again, it is still recursive descent,
      completely unchanged.
      Wadler handles left recursion by parsing into
      a list, and re-processing that list
      into left recursive form.
      Wadler's example grammar only has one operator,
      so the issue of precedence does not arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of one paradigm to solve them all,
      Wadler ends up with a two layered approach,
      with a hackish bottom layer and an awkward interface.
      This undercuts
      the simplicity and elegance of the combinator approach.

      Precedence is provided by the combinator parser

      Associativity is provided by re-processing the

    <p>As we have seen,
      the literature introducing monads and combinator
      parsing added nothing to what is already known
      about parsing algorithms.
      We have focused on it for three reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Functional programming will have had a profound influence
        on the way the profession sees parsing.
      </li>
      <li>The literature shows
        the relative popularity in the 1990's
        of LALR and recursive descent,
	at least among
        one group of highly skilled programmers.
        LALR is not mentioned once in any of the
        articles we have surveyed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The functional programming literature
        also shows that the
        Operator Issue,
        once thought solved,
        is as live an issue in 1996
        as it had been at the end of 1961.

    <h1 id="h1-2004_peg">
    2004: PEG
    </h1>
    <p>Implementers by now are avoiding
      <tt>yacc</tt>, but the demand for
      declarative parsers remains.
      In 2004,
      Bryan Ford<a id="footnote-125-ref" href="#footnote-125">[125]</a>
      fills this gap by
      repackaging the nearly-forgotten
      <a href="#text-GTDPL">GTDPL</a>.
      Ford's new algorithm,
      PEG,
      is declarative, always linear,
      and has an attractive new syntax.</p>
    <p>
      But PEG, like
      <a href="#text-1960-glennie">Glennie's 1960 syntax formalism</a>,
      is pseudo-declarative.
      PEG uses BNF notation,
      but it does not parse the BNF grammar described by the notation:
      PEG achieves unambiguity by finding only a subset of the parses
      of its BNF grammar.
      And, like its predecessor GTDPL,
      in practice it is usually impossible to determine what the subset
      is.
      The best a programmer
      usually can
      do is to create a test suite and fiddle with the PEG description
      until it passes.
      Problems not covered
      by the test suite will be encountered at runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEG takes the old joke that
      <q>the code is
        the documentation</q>
      one step further --
      with PEG it is often the case that
      nothing documents the grammar,
      not even the code.
      Under this circumstance, creating reliable software is impossible.
      As it is usually used,
      PEG is the nitroglycerin of LL parsing --
      slightly more powerful than LL(1), but too dangerous to be worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEG, in safe use, would essentially be LL(1)<a id="footnote-126-ref" href="#footnote-126">[126]</a>.
      Those adventurous souls who parse operator expressions under
      PEG typically seem to parse the operator expressions as lists,
      and re-process them in the semantics.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      With this single line
      in the middle of a change list hundreds of lines long,
      GNU announces a major event in parsing history.
      (Bison, an LALR parser, is the direct descendant of Steve Johnson's
      <tt>yacc</tt>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For three decades, the industry's flagship C compilers have
      used LALR as their parser -- proof of the claim that LALR and serious
      parsing are equivalent.
      Now, GNU replaces LALR with the technology
      that LALR replaced a quarter century earlier: recursive descent.</p>

    <p>Jeffrey Kegler (the author of this timeline) releases the first
      practical implementation of Joop Leo's algorithm<a id="footnote-128-ref" href="#footnote-128">[128]</a>.
      Named Marpa, the new parser is general, table-driven, declarative,
      and linear for LRR,
      which in turn is a superset of the LR grammars discussed in
      <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>.<a id="footnote-129-ref" href="#footnote-129">[129]</a>.
      This means it is also linear for most of the grammar classes we have discussed in this
      timeline:
    </p><ul>
      <li>LL(k) grammars for all finite k, including LL(1) grammars.</li>
      <li>LR(k) grammars for all finite k.</li>
      <li>LALR grammars.</li>
      <li>Operator grammars.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a vast class of grammars,
      and Marpa has the important feature that it allows a programmer
      to readily determine if their grammar is linear under Marpa.
      Marpa will parse a grammar in linear time, if
    </p><ul id="loc-linearity-rules">
      <li>It is unambiguous<a id="footnote-130-ref" href="#footnote-130">[130]</a>.

      <li>It has no ambiguous right recursions<a id="footnote-132-ref" href="#footnote-132">[132]</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ability to ensure that a grammar can
      be parsed in linear time is highly useful for second-order
      languages --
      a programmer can easily ensure that all her
      automatically generated grammars will be practical.
      Marpa's own DSL will make use of second-order programming.

    <p>
      <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>

      rule problem.
      Kegler solves it by adopting the solution of
      <a href="#bib-Aycock_and_Horspool_2002">Aycock and Horspool 2002</a>.
      Finally,
      in an effort to combine the best of declarative and hand-written parsing,
      Kegler reorders Earley's parse engine so that it
      allows procedural logic.
      As a side effect,
      this gives Marpa excellent error-handling properties.

    <p>
      While the purely
      precedence-driven parsing of
      <a href="#bib-Samelson_and_Bauer_1960">Samelson and Bauer 1960</a>
      and
      <a href="#bib-Pratt_1973">Pratt 1973</a>
      never caught on,
      the use of precedence in parsing remains popular.
      In fact, precedence tables often occur in documentation
      and standards,
      which is a clear sign that they too can play a role
      in human-readable but precise descriptions of grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012, Kegler releases a version of Marpa which allows
      the user to mix Chomskyan and precedence parsing at will<a id="footnote-133-ref" href="#footnote-133">[133]</a>.
      Marpa's
      <q>precedenced statements</q>
      describe expressions

      If
      <q>precedenced statements</q>
      are added to a grammar that Marpa parses in linear
      time, then the grammar remains linear as long as the precedenced statements
      are (after precedence is taken in consideration) unambiguous<a id="footnote-134-ref" href="#footnote-134">[134]</a>.

            </tt></pre>
    <p>Previously operator expression parsers had worked by
      comparing adjacent operators.
      This limited them to binary expressions
      (the ternary expressions in most languages are
      implemented using post-parsing hackery).
      Marpa's
      <q>precedenced expressions</q>
      are not operator-driven --
      operators are used only to avoid ambiguity.
      <q>Precedenced statements</q>
      will directly implement any number of ternary,
      quaternary or n-ary operators.
      Ternary and larger expressions are useful in
      financial calculations,
      and are common in calculus.

    <h1 id="h1-the_operator_issue_as_of_2012">
    The Operator Issue as of 2012
    </h1>
    <p>Marpa allows operator expressions to be parsed as BNF,
      eliminating the need for them.
      On the other hand,
      Marpa's ability to handle second-order languages
      allows it to take statements which describe expressions
      in terms of precedence and association,
      and rewrite them in a natural way into Chomskyan form.
      In this way the grammar writer has all
      the benefits of Chomskyan parsing,
      but is also allowed to describe his grammar in terms
      of operators
      when that is convenient.
      Once again, the Operator Issue seems to be solved,
      but this time perhaps for real.
    </p>
    <h1 id="h1-the_parsing_problem_as_of_2012">
    The Parsing Problem as of 2012
    </h1>
    <p>
      Again recall the four criteria from the original
      statement of the Parsing Problem:
      that a parser be efficient, general, declarative and practical.
      Does Marpa<a id="footnote-136-ref" href="#footnote-136">[136]</a>
      fulfill them?
    </p>
    <p>At first glance, no.
      While Marpa is general, it is not linear or quasi-linear for the
      general case,
      and in that sense,
      Marpa might be considered not efficient enough.
      But to be general, a parser has to parse
      <b>every</b>
      context-free grammar, including
      some wildly ambiguous ones, for which simply printing the
      list of possible parses takes exponential time.
      With the experience of the decades,
      linearity for a fully general BNF parser seems to
      be an unnecessary requirement for a practical parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LRR grammars,
      which Marpa does parse in linear time,
      include every
      other grammar class we have discussed --
      LL(k) for all k,
      LR(k) for all k,
      LALR,
      operator grammars,
      etc.
      If we change our criteria as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>efficient for all LRR grammars,
        and for all grammars parseable in linear time by any
        other parser in practical use;
      </li>
      <li>general;</li>
      <li>declarative; and</li>
      <li>practical.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      then Marpa qualifies.
    </p>
    <p>My teachers came from the generation which created the ALGOL vision
      and started the search for a solution to the Parsing Problem.
      Alan Perlis was one of them.
      Would he have accepted my claim that I have found the solution to the
      problem he posed?
      I do not know.
      But I am certain,
      as anyone else who knew him can attest,
      that he would given me
      a direct and plain-spoken answer.
      In that spirit, I submit this timeline to the candid reader.
      In any case,
      I hope
      that my reader has found this journey
      through the history of parsing informative.

    The controversy over whether Ada actually wrote the first
    computer programs is not important for our purposes.
    For most new machines,
    the first "programs" are written by the electrical engineers
    for their "smoke tests",
    and it is not unlikely that Babbage had
    written programs for his Calculating Engine before Ada.
    All of which misses the point of Ada's
    contribution,
    which is to be the first to realize what software
    is.
    It is the difference between being the first person to build
    and fly a working airplane,
    and being the first person to lay out the foundations
    of aerodynamics.

    The most important ideas come to permeate the culture,
    to the detriment of the reputation of those who discover them.
    As of 2018, small children understand that,
    in order to play a computer game,
    they need not just the game platform (hardware),
    but also the game itself (software).
    Similarly, the idea that
    the medium for creating software is
    a "programming language" seems trivially obvious.
    Ada's discoveries are so deeply embedded in 2023 culture,
    that it is hard to realize that there was once a time
    in which they were, in fact, discoveries.
    <br><br>
    It is hard to appreciate in 2023
    how shocking Ada's ideas were in 1843.
    We experience no crisis of faith when we use our smartphone to
    calculate a square root.
    But for someone in 1843,
    doing square roots meant thinking complex thoughts,
    and it seemed obvious that any entity that could think complex
    thoughts must also have a soul.
    Your cellphone would have been, literally, a "Frankenstein"
    experience for most people in 1843,
    and they would wonder whether you could remove its battery
    without committing murder.

        Markov's purpose seems to have been
        to refute Nekrasov's proof of free will.
	Nekrasov reasoned as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>Events that follow the law of large numbers must be independent.</li>
	<li>Social statistics follow the law of large numbers.</li>
	<li>Social statistics are made up of individual human choices.</li>
	<li>Therefore, individual human choices are independent events.</li>
	<li>Since individual human choices are events independent of
	outside influence,
	human beings have free will.</li>
	</ul>
        Markov demonstrated that the law of large
        numbers also works for dependent events,
	undercutting Nekrasov's proof

        I hope nobody will read this terminological clarification as in any sense
        detracting from Hopper's achievement.
        Whatever it is called, Hopper's program was a major advance,
        both in terms of insight and execution, and her energetic followup
        did much to move forward the events in this timeline.
        Hopper has a big reputation and it is fully deserved.

        In later years,
        Chomsky will make it clear that he never intended
        to avoid semantics:
        <blockquote>
          [...] it would be absurd to develop
          a general syntactic theory
          without assigning an absolutely
          crucial role to semantic considerations,
          since obviously the necessity to support
          semantic interpretation is one of the primary
          requirements
          that the structures
          generated by the syntactic component of a grammar
          must meet.  (<a href="#bib-Chomsky_1978">Chomsky 1978</a>,

        non-technical discussions,
        so that a "manifesto" listing the goals of Parsing Theory
        is hard to find.
        But the first two sentences of the pivotal
        <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>
        may serve as one:
        <br><br>
        "There has been much recent interest in languages
        whose grammar is sufficiently simple
        that an
        <b>efficient</b>
        left-to-right parsing
        algorithm can be
        <b>mechanically produced</b>
        from the grammar.
        In this paper, we define LR(k) grammars,
        which are perhaps the
        <b>most general</b>
        ones of this type, [...]"
        (p. 607, boldface added.)
        <br><br>
        Here Knuth explicitly refers to goals of efficiency,
        declarativeness,
        and generality,
        announcing a trade-off of the first two against
        the second.
        Note Knuth also refers to "left-to-right"
        as a goal,
        but this he makes clear (pp. 607-608) that
        is because he sees it as a requirement
        for efficiency.

          <term>Practical</term>
          here is a catch-all term
          for those properties which Parsing Theory
          de-emphasized.
          As such, the literature rarely explicitly refers
          to practicality as a goal.
          And, in some Parsing Theory papers, it is not a goal,
          at least not directly.
          But I think it can be taken as given that,
          when the discussion was about parsers intended for actual
          use, practicality was a goal.

        Given the capacity of computer memories in 1965,
        LR(1) was clearly impractical.
        With the huge computer memories of 2023,
        that could be reconsidered,
        but even today LR(1) is rare in practical use.
	LR(1) shares
	the poor error-handling that
        the LR(k)-based parsers became known for.
	And, since
        LR(1) is still very limited in its power
	compared to LRR,
	it just does not seem to be worth it.

        In this document
        I will usually speak of a language intension as if it was
        a BNF grammar.
	Admittedly,
        this is a very simplified view of semantics.
	Treating semantics as reducible to the tagged trees produced
	by parsing a BNF grammar
        not only assumes that the language is pure context-free,
        it is not even adequate for most computer
        applications of context-free grammars.
	Most applications require at least some kind
        of post-processing.
        <br><br>
        But this is not a formal mathematical presentation.
        and for our purposes,
        we do not need to actually represent a semantics,
        just the interface to it.
        And the grammars we consider are almost always
        context-free.

      <a href="#text-1961-sakai">Sakai parsers</a>

          In 1964, advocates of stack-based parsing would not

          or "traditional" solution.

        <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>, p. 637.
        Knuth's own language is cautious,
        so it is not 100% clear
        that he believes that the
        future of practical parsing theory lies
        in the pursuit of LR(k) subsets.
        His program for further research
        (Knuth 1961, pp. 637-639)
        also suggests investigation of parsers for superclasses
        of LR(k).
        Indeed,
        Knuth shows (p. 638)
        that he is well aware that some grammars
        beyond LR(k) can be parsed in linear time.
        Knuth also is very much aware (p. 638) that
        it is an open question whether all context-free grammars
        can be parsed in linear time.
        <br><br>
        Knuth even describes a new superclass of his own:
        LR(k,t), which is LR(k) with more aggressive lookahead.
        But Knuth introduces LR(k,t) in dismissive terms:
        "Finally, we might mention another generalization of LR(k)"
        (Knuth 1965, p. 638); and
        "One might choose to call this left-to-right translation,
        although we had to back up a finite amount."
        (p. 639).
        <br><br>
        It is reasonable to suppose
        that Knuth is even more negative about
        the more general approaches that
        he does not bother to mention.
        Knuth's skepticism of more general Chomskyan approaches
        is also suggested by his own plans for his (not yet released) Chapter
        12 of the
        <cite>Art of Computer Programming</cite>,
        in which he planned to use pre-Chomskyan bottom-up methods
        (<a href="#bib-Knuth_1990">Knuth 1990</a>, p. 3).
        <br><br>
        In
        <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>
        (pp. 607-608),
        Knuth had emphasized that
        proceeding strictly left-to-right
        is necessary for efficiency reasons.
        So subsequent researchers were probably correct in
        reading into Knuth a prediction that
        research into beyond-LR(k)
        parsing would be not be fruitful.
        Regardless of what Knuth himself believed,
        the consensus of the parsing theorists is not
        in doubt:
        interest in beyond-LR parsing will almost disappear
        after 1965.
        The theorist's attention will be focused almost
        exclusively on Knuth's suggestions for research within the stack-based
        model (p. 637).
        These included grammar rewrites;
        streamlining of the LR(k) tables;
        and research into LR(k) subclasses.

        Knuth also discusses some ambiguities,
        and some intermixing of semantics with syntax,
        in the
        ALGOL report.
        But Knuth (quite appropriately)
        notes that BNF was new when it was written,
        and treats these other issues
        as problems with the ALGOL specification.

        My account of PEG is negative because almost all
        real-life PEG practice is unsafe,
        and almost all of the literature offers no cautions

        Ford's PEG is efficient
        and does have specialized uses.

        In fact,
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>,
	and therefore Marpa,
        is linear for a superset of the LRR
        grammars.
        It is not known (in fact it is not decidable, see
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>, p. 175.)
        just how large the class of grammars
        that Marpa parses in linear time is.
	<br><br>
        It is known that there are both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars
        for which <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a> is not linear.
        In the general case, Marpa and <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>
	obey the bounds of Earley's algorithm --
        they are worst-case O(n**2) for unambiguous grammars;
        and worst-case O(n**3) for ambiguous grammars.
        On the other hand, Marpa follows
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>
        in being linear for many ambiguous grammars,
        including those of most practical interest.

<p id="footnote-130"><b>130</b>.
          In the general case, ambiguity is undecidable, but
          in practice it is usually straight-forward for a programmer
          to determine that the grammar he wants is unambiguous.
          Note that while the general case is undecidable,
          Marpa will tell the programmer if a parse
          (a grammar with a particular input)
          is ambiguous.
	  In fact, since Marpa can parse ambiguous grammars,
	  the error message that Marpa produces shows where the ambiguity is.
 <a href="#footnote-130-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-131"><b>131</b>.
A
          <q>marker</q>, in this sense, is something in the input
          that shows where the middle of a middle recursion is,
          without having to go to the end and count back.
          Whether or not a grammar is unmarked is, in general,
          an undecidable problem.
          But in practice, there is a easy rule:
          if a person can
          <q>eyeball</q>
          the middle of a long
          middle recursion, and does not need to count from both
          ends to find it,
          the grammar is
          <q>marked</q>.
 <a href="#footnote-131-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-132"><b>132</b>.
          This is a very pedantic requirement,
          which practical programmers can in fact ignore.
          Any programmer who has found and eliminated
          ambiguities in his grammar will usually,
          in the process,
          also have found and
          eliminated ambiguous right recursions,
          since it is easier to eliminate them than
          to determine if they create a overall ambiguity.
          In fact,
          it is an open question whether there
          <em>are</em>
          any unambiguous
          grammars with ambiguous right recursions --
          neither Joop Leo or I know of any.

        Internally, Marpa rewrites precedenced statements into BNF.
        Marpa's rewrite does not use middle recursions
        and does not introduce any new ambiguities
        so that, following Marpa's
        <a href="#loc-linearity-rules">linearity
          rules</a>, the result must be linear.
 <a href="#footnote-134-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-135"><b>135</b>.
        In this, precedence goes from tightest to loosest.
        Single bars (<tt>|</tt>) separate RHS's of equal precedence.
        Double bars (<tt>||</tt>) separate RHS's of different precedence.
        Associativity defaults to left,
        and exceptions are indicated by the value of the
        <tt>assoc</tt>
        adverb.
        Note that these
        <q>precedenced statements</q>,
        like all of Marpa's DSL,
        are parsed by Marpa itself.
        The statement shown has the semantic adverbs removed for clarity.
